# DRIVER-DROWSINESS-DETECTION
#### A real-time drowsiness detection system for drivers, which alerts the driver if they fall asleep due to fatigue while still driving.
#### The computer vision algorithm used for the implementation uses a trifold approach to detect drowsiness, including
#### detection of faces, measurement of eye aspect ratio (to detect closure of eyes), and measurement of mouth aspect ratio
#### (to detect yawning).
#### TECH STACK: Python, OpenCV, Dlib Library
